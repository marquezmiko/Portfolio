import Image from 'next/image'

# Importing
A common place for devs familiar with React to get icons is <a href="https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons"> react-icons </a>.
Here one can find a massive library of free-to-use icons commonly imported as simply as
```
import { FaBeer } from 'react-icons/fa';
class Question extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
  }
}
```

However I hit two snags trying this with the "Projects" page of this website:
1. Icons kept adding a newline before and after the text I wanted it to be inline with.
2. Deployment kept failing the simple `npm install react-icons --save` I was able to do on my local machine.

## Importing
### Problem:
Doing a simple `## FindYourSpace <GoTelescope />` would sadly do my H2-level 'FindYourSpace' title, then put the telescope below, then leave an awkward gap to the sub-header H3-level text.
<Image
  src="/images/icons-beforeCSS.png"
  alt="Bad CSS Spacing"
  width={825}
  height={450}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>
### Investigation:
using chrome dev tools I noticed that the svg icon was a sibling element to the H2 element. I then saw that the inherited css had `display: block` set. Setting this to `display: inline` resulted in the desired behavior.
### Solution:
Add a custom class `## FindYourSpace <GoTelescope className="react-icon" />` I could then add CSS to in main.css. Using `display: inline`. And voila!
<Image
  src="/images/icons-afterCSS.png"
  alt="Good CSS Spacing"
  width={825}
  height={450}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>
## Deployment
### Problem:
Vercel usually nicely auto-deploys anything pushed to main. From the logs I can tell it runs a quick install and build check of dependencies as a first stage of the deployment. Unfortunately I kept failing with errors like below
<Image
  src="/images/icons-fail.png"
  alt="Failed Deployment"
  width={1125}
  height={750}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>
### Investigation:
Thinking initially that perhaps this was just vercel not running `npm install` correctly, I found in the settings page of the deployment that I could override and insert a command to run pre-deployment. I attempted `npm install` and `npm install react-icons --save` but to no solution. Slow down, dissect the problem. 
### Solution:
The error specifically mentions that it cannot **resolve** the import. I looked in the node-modules directory and noticed our issue, the actual modules were lower case like `react-icons/go`. Well there's our issue. Swapping out the uppercases with lower case resolved this.
