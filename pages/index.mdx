# Justo Marquez

<div className="intro">
<h2>Hello! I'm Justo "Miko" Marquez.</h2>

<h3>
I am currently an Integration Engineer at <a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic Systems</a>. I specialize in data conversions from system-to-system, as well as developing, debugging, implementing, and supporting EMR software integrations.

I have over 6 years of experience in healthcare technology but my interests and passions in tech extend far beyond what software can do in a hospital or clinic.

Check out some recent projects <a href="/projects">here</a>!
