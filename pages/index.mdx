# Your Name

Hey! I'm Justo "Miko" Marquez, currently an Integration Engineer at <a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic Systems</a>. I have over 6 years of experience in healthcare technology but my interest and passions extend far beyond what tech can do in a hospital or clinic.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
